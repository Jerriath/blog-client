                        I am self taught, Javascript web developer with a degree in physics. At the time of creating this blog application, I was 
                        working on a free, online webdev curriculum known as "The Odin Project." I am very interested in random facts from all 
                        different kinds of fields from physics (obviously) to psychology to even culinary. I am an avid supporter of the idea that
                        everyone should exercise and strive to be a healthy, but more importantly, happy person.
